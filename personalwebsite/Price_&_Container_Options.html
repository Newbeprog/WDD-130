            Like other shops we carry containers sizes in small, medium and
            large. We also sell it in cartons in sizes from 8oz to 16oz. We also
            carry sugar cones, waffle cones and chocolate dip waffle cones. A
            small costs an extra of 0.50 cents. Medium costs 1.00 dollar. A
            large cost 2.00 dollars. An 8oz carton costs around 5 dollars per
            carton. The 16oz costs about 20 dollars for each carton. One scoop
            of ice cream costs 1.67 dollar per scoop of ice cream. Up to three
            scoops of ice cream will cost 5.01 dollars not including tax. Pete’s
            Ice Cream shop offer sales seasonally for the common holidays that
            are celebrated. We also offer sales on ice cream that is more than a
            week or two old and when there is an over abundance of ice cream
            that was made for the week. Not only that we also offer daily
            coupons depending on the type of ice cream. Costs may vary depending
            on the cost of labor and the amount each ingredient. Pete’s Ice
            cream shop will have a monthly raffle for 50% off any container or
            carton. Not only that if they get the store reward card they can get
            in store sales.
