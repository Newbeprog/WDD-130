      <h4> About Us</h4>
      <p>
        Pete’s Ice cream shop was started the 21st of June 1960 by Peter Malone in Houston, Texas. For years the Malone family made homemade ice cream and on many of occasions would bring it to community activities through the years. Peter’s family ice cream has through community activities became famous throughout the county. The Malone family owned a farm and for many years their farm did not do well. When Peter graduated from school, and he knew that his family needed his help to provide for the family so they can keep their farm. Knowing that his family’s homemade ice cream was well liked throughout the county brought the idea to start a family ice cream shop.  Although he knew that he could not do it on his own.  As Peter looked into financing the ice cream shop, he recruited a local businessman by the name of John Lockwood. They both decided that it would be best to start locally as their funds were low. As they started up, they served the common flavors of ice cream during the 60s such as vanilla and chocolate. After a couple of years of business Peter Malone and John Lockwood expanded to near by towns and started to advertise through the news papers. After many years managing the shop Peter past it down to his son and retired.
