            Pete’s Ice cream shop was started the 21st of June 1960 by Peter
            Malone in Houston, Texas. For years the Malone family made homemade
            ice cream and on many of occasions would bring it to community
            activities through the years. Peter’s family ice cream has through
            community activities became famous throughout the county. The Malone
            family owned a farm and for many years their farm did not do well.
            When Peter graduated from school, and he knew that his family needed
            his help to provide for the family so they can keep their farm.
            Knowing that his family’s homemade ice cream was well liked
            throughout the county brought the idea to start a family ice cream
            shop. Although he knew that he could not do it on his own. As Peter
            looked into financing the ice cream shop, he recruited a local
            businessman by the name of John Lockwood. They both decided that it
            would be best to start locally as their funds were low. As they
            started up, they served the common flavors of ice cream during the
            60s such as vanilla and chocolate. After a couple of years of
            business Peter Malone and John Lockwood expanded to near by towns
            and started to advertise through the news papers. After many years
            managing the shop Peter past it down to his son and retired.
